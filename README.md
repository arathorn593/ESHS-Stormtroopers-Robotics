ESHS-Stormtroopers-Robotics
===========================

The code used for the ESHS Stormtrooper's robotics team from 2011-2014

The repo includes code that younger programmers wrote for training, code writen by me that was never implemented, and code writen by me that was used in competition. The code in the "Code 2013-14" folder is the most recent and clean.
